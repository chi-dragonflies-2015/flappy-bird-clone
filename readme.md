# Flappy Bird Clone

This is a simple flappy bird clone I made using the Phaser.js javascript game engine and HTML 5. If you'd like a detailed walkthrough on how to build this very app, [this tutorial](http://blog.lessmilk.com/how-to-make-flappy-bird-in-html5-1/) on the lessmilk blog is what I used (it's fantastic). I found that building this app was a great intro to the basics of Phaser, and highly recommend checking it out if you're interested!
